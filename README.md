Sia is a mobile assistant (integrated with the current SIA app) that uses AI-driven predictive analysis to display relevant information regarding a passenger’s flight and airport journey. It assists the passenger from the moment he/she leaves his/her house up to the arrival of the passenger at the journey destination. 

It digitizes simple yet time-consuming processes such as finding info regarding check-in procedure, departure gates, time taken to travel between points in the airport, etc. thereby saving the passenger valuable time and significantly enhancing their airport experience.

It also digitizes entertainment services for passengers, integrates them with the flight’s on-board entertainment system and makes airport shopping online from offline
